 SynapseFi - Wave 4 Update Release Notes
 RWA Marketplace & Governance Transformation

 1. Executive Summary
This update ("Wave 4") fundamentally transforms the platform's governance section into a fully functional, professional Real World Asset (RWA) Marketplace. The release introduces strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure regulatory compliance and operational security, separating "Issuer/Admin" authority from "Investor/User" participation.

 2. Core Features

 A. Professional RWA Marketplace
- **New Interface**: Replaced the legacy governance page with a high-density, financial-grade marketplace UI.
- **Asset Categories**: Support for Real Estate, Bonds, Private Credit, and Equity.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by asset type, status, and dynamic search capability.
- **Visual Design**: Implemented a "Dark/Purple" professional theme consistent with institutional DeFi platforms.

 B. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Dual-Role System**:
    - **Admin (Issuer/Verifier)**: Absolute authority over asset lifecycle (Approve, Reject, Publish, Price).
    - **User (Investor/Proposer)**: Restricted permissions focused on discovery and proposal submission.
- **Role Toggler**: Integrated "View as" toggle for rapid testing and demonstration of permission scopes.

 C. User Proposal System
- **Asset Submission**: Users can now submit "Draft" asset proposals via a dedicated modal.
- **Data Capture**:
    - Asset Metadata (Name, Type, Maturity).
    - Financial Metrics (APY, Min Investment, Risk Profile).
    - Documentation (Mock upload for Valuation Reports, Legal Opinions).
- **Restriction**: User-submitted assets enter a `Pending Approval` state and are **not** visible to the public until Admin verification.

 D. Admin Command Center (Dashboard)
- **Dedicated Route**: New protected `/admin` route and sidebar navigation (visible only to Admins).
- **Management Console**:
    - **Pending Review Queue**: centralized view of all assets awaiting approval.
    - **One-Click Actions**: Approve or Reject assets directly from the table row.
    - **Live Status Updates**: Immediate state reflection (Draft -> Active / Rejected).
- **Price Feed Control**:
    - **Inline Editing**: Admins can update APY/Prices for active assets directly in the dashboard without navigating away.
    - **Official Pricing**: Admin updates are treated as the "Official Oracle" source for the platform.

 3. Technical Implementation Details

 Frontend Architecture
- **State Management (Zustand)**:
    - Centralized store (`useStore.ts`) handling `rwaAssets`, `userRole`, and CRUD operations.
    - Persisted state logic for seamless user experience during session.
- **Component Design**:
    - `Marketplace.tsx`: Consumer-facing view with role-aware rendering.
    - `AdminDashboard.tsx`: Management-facing view with table-based density.
    - `AssetProposalModal.tsx`: Form-based component for data ingestion.
    - `Sidebar.tsx`: Dynamic navigation based on active user role.

 Security & Compliance Logic
- **Permission Gates**:
    - Users cannot trigger `approveAsset` or `updateAssetPrice` actions.
    - "Invest" buttons are disabled for non-active assets.
    - Admin routes are conditionally rendered.
- **Workflow Enforcement**:
    - Proposal -> Pending -> Admin Review -> Active/Rejected.
    - This ensures no unauthorized asset ever goes live on the marketplace.

 E. On-chain Price Feed & Contract Integration
 - **RWARegistry**: On-chain asset approval registry (address: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3)
 - **RWAOracle**: Official price feed (address: 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512)
 - **Fallback Logic**: Marketplace cards use on-chain prices with local state fallback

### 4. How to Test
1. **Navigate to Marketplace**: Observe the new layout and "Coming Soon" / "Active" assets.
2. **User Flow**:
    - Ensure toggle is set to "User".
    - Click "Propose Asset", fill the form, and submit.
    - Verify the asset does *not* appear in the main list immediately.
3. **Admin Flow**:
    - Switch toggle to "Admin".
    - Click the new "Shield" icon in the Sidebar to go to the Admin Dashboard.
    - Locate the "Pending Approval" asset.
    - Click "Approve" (Green Check).
    - Go back to Marketplace to see the asset is now "Active" and investable.
    - Try editing the APY of an asset in the Admin Dashboard.
4. **On-chain Price Verification**:
    - As Admin, approve at least one asset and update its APY.
    - Confirm the corresponding `setPrice` transaction on the `RWAOracle` contract.
    - Refresh the Marketplace; the card APY should match `RWAOracle.getPrice(assetId) / 100`, falling back to local APY only if the oracle read fails.
